Tools to make interacting with the APIs of Fio Banka easier for those who do
not want to use the API Plus app (it is a GUI after all) or, in the case of
signer, want use the more standard ways of maintaining their keys.

fioread
-------

Application (and a Python module) to display the last transactions for an
account in a terminal.

Based on the official spec at http://www.fio.cz/docs/cz/API_Bankovnictvi.pdf
with some guesswork as not all the fields are adequately specified for the json
field order/names.

The module does not implement the complete API, only retrieves the list of
transactions since the last retrieval and lays them out in a useful format.

signer
------

A stub to document the "new" fiosign protocol (introduced around April 2013).

The intent is to create a library that makes it possible to interact with the
user's gpg-agent using the Assuan protocol and let them set up a GPG (sub)key
for use when they interact with the bank. Deferring to a gpg agent lets the
library not worry about the key at all, so that it can even exist on a
smartcard.
